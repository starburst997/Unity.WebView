# Unity.WebView
Display WebView in Unity

This is a fork of [Gree's](https://github.com/gree) [unity-webview](https://github.com/gree/unity-webview)

Support iOS / Android / Mac

This overlay a native webview on top of Unity (not a texture in world space)

You need to build the binary yourself for Android / Mac (`Source~/Mac/install.sh` / `Source~/Android/install.sh --unity UNITY_PATH`)
